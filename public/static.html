        <h1>Hello</h1>
        <p>
            this is a static page, i did it by useing the function use served by exress function => "app.use" then
            in it a I used the origenenal file of express befor makeing it a function and makeing it call "static"
        </p>
           <h3> => "app.use(express.static())"</h3>

        <p> 
            where express came from => const express = require("express") after downloading express
            and app came from => "const app = express()" where express() it's the same the express that referded
            befor but we add () after it
        </p>
        <p>  
            to make it more clear after ""const express = require("express")""
        </p>
        <p>  
            we can us express in 2 format 
        </p>
        <p>      
            1-express.function
        </p>
        <p>  
            2-express().function
        </p>
        <p>  
            and it's best to refer the express() to another name like "const app = exoress()"
        </p> 
        <p> 
            then in static I referded to the directory path of the static pages by a packeg "path" served by node
            then I used the function "join" in path=> path.join to join 2 pathes the firt path is the directory
            path, I can get it by write "__dirname" it's provide by node for example 
            console.log(__dirname) will write to the console the path from the hardesk (for example "c:\user\sultan\...")
            to the directory name (for example I used the file app.js in the directory "sever" it will get the path from 
            the hardesk location "C" to the directory name "server") the join it with the path ../index it says that
            go out the directory server then go to the ditrctory index witch has all the static pages so it will be like
        </p> 
            <h3>=> "app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "../index")))"</h3>
        
        
    </body>
